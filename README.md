# HNAR-Sourcecode-Jacket-Branch

This is the Source code to hnar 3.0
This Code is only for those who feel brave & understand UE4
YOU ARE GOING TO NEED VISUAL STUDIO.

You are ALSO going to have to supply your own copy of uds  https://www.fab.com/listings/84fda27a-c79f-49c9-8458-82401fb37cfb
This i cannot supply for reasons. there is a preexisting folder for you located in the content folder. just place uds contents there before starting the project up

this is for modders/speedrunners who want to understand how this game was put together.

id love to see some sort of multiplayer implementation
